This software is being developed in conjunction with the NAS
project described here:

http://coderslike.us/2010/08/06/how-to-build-a-local-nas-backed-by-amazon-s3/

The goal is to build a local NAS device that provides good performance and
also backs up all data to S3.  We want the files to be stored in the original
form in S3 so we are not using a block-device layer on top of S3 such as
S3Backer or ElasticDrive.
